				According to Halopedia, the map is set in and around the West Market of Mombasa, Earth. It takes place after the Battle of Mombasa, as the city is in the midst of an urban renewal. 
				While the plan to rebuild the city was ambitious and expensive, investment from the UEG and UNSC activity at the Voi Excession has led to some of the metropolis being revitalized.
				Numerous businesses like The Roost Star and Kuku's Cafe dot the map, while streets like Haller Street and Kuku Street cut through the area. A partially-constructed space elevator can be seen to the southeast, 
				possibly a repaired Mombasa Tether or simply its replacement.
