						According to Halopedia, the map is set within a facility owned by Aquarius Terraforming Solutions, 
						a human company that specializes in terraforming barren planets so that they can sustain life. 
						This particular facility is being used to perform tests on water and various forms of plant life.

					<h2> Callouts </h2>

						As you explore Aquarius, you'll see Callouts appear in the bottom lefthand corner of your HUD. These will help you give a name to parts of the map so you can better-communicate with teammates. You'll also see these names pop up when making use of the Mark ability, which helps you ping locations. The Callouts on Aquarius are:
